Black of my eye
Frame of my mind
Drink never dry
Love of my Life


Parting is winter, your absence is sorrow
I wish to stay until the morrow
Between your fair arms
when the nightingale sings, 'Terrow'

The corners of your eyes
sparkle and they glisten
when you speak your solid words
everyone will listen

Black of my eye
Frame of my mind
Drink never dry
Love of my Life
